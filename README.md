# React Shapes

React/Redux app to play with some geometric shapes.

# Instructions

Clone this repository, then inside the folder run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
That's it! The application will be running on *http://localhost:3000*.

# Development

All the React (jsx) and Javascript code has been written following [Airbnb's Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with [ESLint's](https://eslint.org/) help. Most of component's CSS attributes are defined with [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), which helps to keep the app well organized, maintainable and scalable.

# Tests

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) has been used to test all the functions responsible to handle the geometric shapes. You can check the tests running:
```
npm test
```
