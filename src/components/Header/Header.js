                    Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with
                    the properties and relationships of points,
                    lines, angles, surfaces and solids.

                <div style={aboutContent}>
                  <span>
                    Geometry says, for example, that an equilateral
                    triangle must have all three sides equal. It also
                    defines some properties of another geometric shape: the
                    parallelogram. By definition, a parallelogram is a simple
                    quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. Square
                    and rhomboid are types of parallelograms.

                    Now that you have some theory, could you say how many
                    parallelograms can be formed from 3 random points? Where
                    can the 4th point be positioned to form a quadrilateral
                    with two pairs of parallel sides? To answer the questions,
                    probably you would have to go deeper into concepts of analytic
                    geometry like how to define the

                    Or, if you are not a big fan of Math, you can just play with
                    React Shapes! It will do all the dirty job for you :)

                </div>
                <h2>How it works?</h2>
                <div style={aboutContent}>
                  <span>
                    You just have to define 3 initial points, by clicking inside the
                    green box. That is it! After that, React Shapes will generate the 4th
                    point of the parallelogram, and draw it in blue for you. It is also
                    possible to shuffle the 4th point so you can check all the parallelograms
                    that can be formed from the points you clicked. Be careful about the box
                    boundaries, only parallelograms within the limits will be formed, and
                    the shuffle button will be disabled if is not possible to form another
                    parallelogram!

                  <span>
                    A yellow circle will also be formed, having the same area and center of mass
                    of the parallelogram. You can reset all the points anytime you want, clicking
                    on the red button below the green box. If you want to move your shapes, click
                    on any of the points, and click again once you are finished. Have fun!
